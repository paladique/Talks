In the beginning, Microsoft started developing the .NET Framework back in 90s. During this time they began working on standardizing the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification and the C# language, which was eventually approved by ECMA and ISO in 2000. The .NET Framework 1.0 was rolled out in 2002. [[1](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf)][[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework)]

Because the CLI was published as an open standard, you could make your own implementation of it, which gave way to projects like Mono, open sourced in 2001, with 1.0 released in 2004. One of Mono’s aim’s was to make the .NET Framework accessible on any platform. 

Mono project got a little controversial as there were concerns about patent violations as the implementation contained portions of the .NET Framework suspected to be under patents. It got to the point where it was thought that developing C# was considered dangerous because of  Microsoft’s patents, and that anything created in C# should be excluded from Linux distros. One notable program was Banshee, a media player that was removed from Ubuntu distros. [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software))] 

It appeared as if Microsoft slowly warmed up to Open Source in 2008 when it started shipping JQuery within Visual Studio, then KnockoutJS in 2010. Two year later in 2012 microsoft open sources it’s interpretation of MVC,  ASP.NET MVC, followed by EntityFramework object-relational mapper.

In Nov 2014 it was announced that .NET Core, a cross platform port of the .NET Framework, is open source, and available on Github. This consists of the the CoreCLR (common language runtime), and CoreFX, .NET’s foundational libraries, supported by the Roslyn and the LLILC Compiler. [[5]()]

.Net Core started with a small set of libraries at first, and mapped out their plan to release others as OS on github. As of a few days ago they are 98% complete. [[6](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx-progress/blob/master/src-diff/README.md)]

At that same time .NET Foundation was born, it’s mission was to “to foster open development and collaboration around the Microsoft .NET development framework.” to “broaden and strengthen the future of the .NET ecosystem by promoting openness and community participation to encourage innovation.” [[7](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/)]

The .NET Open Source Community has been buzzing ever since. The .NET Foundation recently showed their appreciation of their contributors by sending them mugs engraved with the  SHA id of their first commit. [[8](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/02/thank-you-for-your-contributions.aspx)]

To conclude now’s an exiting time to check out what going on with .NET, there is an overwhelming number of libraries and projects to choose from, and overwhelming support from its contributors.
