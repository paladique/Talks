#Lightning Talks

This is all the slides, transcripts, and references from my lightning talks.

* 10/23/15 Catskills Conf: .NET ❤️s Open Source

Current Feedback:
* Slide Contrast - hard to read on stage. If using such a dark color like "Visual Studio Purple" make sure text color complements that. White might have been a better option.
